# eightQueens
This is a collection of solutions to the Eight Queen Problem (N-Queen Problem).
I looked up https://wiki.c2.com/?EightQueensInManyProgrammingLanguages 
and tried to use the given source codes.
If I encountered problems, I looked up other sources.
None of the source code is written by me,
except by changing parameters (setting n to higher numbers).
